# Content Marketing

Here at Codelitt Incubator, we believe the best marketing we can do is to provide real value through education. We have a team full of experts from software engineering, web applications, mobile applications, machine learning, artificial intelligence, user experience design, user interface design, and product management. We believe in externalizing as much of our knowledge as we can; for our customers, our communities, and our future employees. 

Our open source and open education ethos have been founding principals of our company. Some of our largest and most valued customers have started conversations with us because of our educational posts. A rising tide lifts all boats. 

# Process:

This document serves as a deep dive into the different considerations. Please read through this doc before getting started. However, these steps should all be completed and tracked in Trello. The Trello workflow will help you make sure you’ve completed everything below. Here is a broad overview of the process before we dive in:

1. Idea

2. Writing (Includes the goal and content)

3. Approval (Go through these steps before you ask for approval)

4. Publish (Includes publishing AND after you publish)

5. Published (Tracking metrics)

# Blog

Our blog is probably the main location where we post our content. We have tagged sections that are geared towards our different audiences, for example our [Corporate-Ed tag which contains content geared towards educating our corporate partners. ](http://www.codelitt.com/blog/tag/corporate-ed/)Here is the process for each post:

# The Idea (step 1)

We keep a list of ideas in the "Marketing 2.0" Trello board. When you’re in the shower, laying awake at night, etc, and an idea comes to you - WRITE IT DOWN. Later on, add it to the Trello list. Some ideas, you won’t follow through on, but they’re good inspiration for later. If you don’t write them down or put them in Trello, it’s likely the day-to-day will distract you and we could lose valuable content. If you want to personally write the post yourself, make sure to tag yourself as a member in the trello card. The best posts tell stories, and offer practical knowledge or insight. 

###For example, consider these two post titles:
####An introduction to Docker
vs.
####How we use Docker to save 20 hours a week

Admittedly, the two titles don't share a 1:1 relationship so comparing them might be incorrect, but it's clear that the second post is more interesting and is *probably* more actionable.  

# The Content (step 2)

When you choose a topic and have added yourself as a member of the trello card, move the card to the "in progress" list on Marketing 2.0. Then, create a new Google Doc, add the title of your post as the document title, make sure to set the sharing to "Everyone in Codelitt can edit", and paste the link in the card. Then you can notify Ben that you've chosen your topic. In that Google Doc, you should create a breif outline of your post. Bullet points are fine. The goal of this is to align Ben with what you want to write about, so he can ensure that it's on target for Codelitt and guide the story and structure of the post. You and Ben will breifly talk about it, and then you are off on your own!


# The Goal

Every post should have a goal. Don’t start writing without some goal in mind. Here are some examples:

1. Educate <audience category> on <insert subject here> (Probably the most common for us)

2. Provide an overview on <insert subject, tech, etc, here>

3. Provide insights on <insert subject, tech, etc, here>

4. Discuss the problems of <insert subject, tech, etc here>

5. Show <audience category> process of <insert subject here>

6. Announce X

Be specific with your goals. Ideally, your goal will have the audience it is directed at, what you aim to provide the audience with in your post, and even could include what action you would like the reader to take. 

# After your draft
When you finish your first draft, move the card to the "posts to be edited by Ben" list in the Trello board, and notify Ben to take a look at it. The post will be edited by Ben, sent back to you for revisions, then sent to the team as a whole for spot checking before scheduling it to be posted.

### Here is how to get started on our blogging platform:

1. Get an invite for the blog. Ask Cody. These will be posted under YOUR name to give proper credit. 

2. Include a photo of yourself and a Bio in your profile.

3. Click "New Post".

4. Title is at the top.

5. Tags are in the black bar at the bottom. Make sure to tag appropriately. Explore tags of other posts. Add anything that is relevant. Some distinct tags you MUST include are:

    1. startup-ed - if geared towards educating startups

    2. corporate-ed - if geared towards educating our corporate partners

    3. educational - if it’s either one

6. Settings for SEO stuff like the URL, metadata, etc are in the "gear" button on the bottom left. URL should include all the important, non-filler words of the title. Metadata description field should entice the searcher to click. 

7. An image for the top of your post is located here in the "gear" button menu as well

8. Post content is edited in markdown.[ Here’s an overview. ](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/)

### Here are some guidelines for your content:

1. Include a header photo. We have a premium subscription to DeathToTheStockPhoto.com. [Here is another list of great locations](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b#.z76numv79) to source images that don’t infringe upon any rights and are actually well produced (as opposed to terrible stock photos). 

2. Beyond a header image, remember that graphs, infographics, and other images often do a great job of helping explain a point and breaking up a wall of text. 

3. Your title should be descriptive and enticing

4. Your first paragraph should be to the point and explain you goal in the post (possibly background). The point of the first paragraph is to demonstrate that the rest of the article is worth a read. 

5. Break content up with H2/H3 tags (`##` and `###` in markdown respectively). This makes it scannable, helps organize the content, and increases usefulness

6. Don’t be an echo chamber. Say something original. 

# When it's published (Step 3)

Add link to forums WHERE IT WILL BE FOUND USEFUL. We are ANTI-spam here. For example, a non-technical intro will not be appreciated by a very technical forum. A corporate education piece will not be useful to a startup crowd, etc. A few examples of different places where our content does quite well are:

    1. Hacker News

    2. Reddit (depends on content and subreddit)

    3. Product Hunt (when we release new products)

    4. Innovation Groups 

5. Don’t be part of the problem (spam). If you’ve written great content, then it will stand on its own legs. 

# Email lists

Our lists are aggregated from people who sign up on our blog or that we have done business with && have told us they would like to receive updates. 

*We do NOT purchase lists or send unwanted emails. Any employee caught doing this, will be reprimanded and made to fix his grievance of the affected people. This aligns with our general company value of not being evil.*

## List segments

The lists below contain information about the type of people who should be added to this list IF they’ve requested to receive updates either personally or signed up on the blog. 

* Startups - Investors, employees/founders of startups, and people who work in the startup community.

* Tech - This is a highly technical list. People either work very integrated with technology to the point they know what `null` means or are engineers themselves. 

* Design - These are normally people working in the design industry, work closely with design, or generally benefit from knowing a great deal about design. 

* Innovation - This list is largely people working in the innovation, R&D, or skunkworks departments of companies. The types of posts they generally go for are our "corporate-ed" and other high-level posts which serve to educate larger organizations on new technologies, agile processes, and startup methodologies for achieving greater disruption.
