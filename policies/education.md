Education
==========

In an effort to help you all meet your professional goals for the next quarter, the company has agreed to pay for your education through approved educational programs and efforts. As with most educational programs, this would be study completed in your own time. It's exciting to be able to offer you the opportunity to grow, but also remember that partner projects are your priority. If you have finished all you can for the current time, then by all means use your extra time to study or work through exercises, however education is normally an extracurricular activity.

To enroll on or enquire about an educational program, speak with Cody or Vince about the opportunities and programs available.
