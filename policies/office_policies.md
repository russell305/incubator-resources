Office Policies
===============


##Work hours
We are a remote team that favours progress and results over set hours. You may, for example, work from midnight to 8am if you desire to. 

These freedoms do come with conditions:

- You must make yourself available for the 11 a.m. EST standup meeting.
- You must make yourself available for any normal workday calls which may regard your position in the team. 
- We encourage you to spend any free time you have doing research, contributing to open source projects, working on your 20% time projects, and optimizing tasks, code, whatever!
