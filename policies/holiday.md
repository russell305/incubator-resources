Paid and unpaid holiday
========================

During your first year of employment, you are allowed up to 2 weeks of paid vacation. In your second year of employment, you are allowed up to 3 weeks of paid vacation. Vacation allowance will reset anually. If you start mid-year, vacation is pro-rated (e.g. If you start Q4, .25 * 2 weeks of paid vacation is allotted). 

Please give advanced notice so we can account for the time you will be out of the office and adjust where work is allocated. We do not guarantee any vacation time with less than 2 weeks advanced notice. At least 1 month advanced notice is preferable because it enables the team to sufficiently plan for your absence and smiley faces are given. 

Whilst we do not monitor the hours that you work and you're free to set your own schedule, taking time off for holiday without notification could result in a [Concern Report.](../processes/hr/employee_concern_report.md)

There is no limit to the amount of sick days taken unless an abusive pattern becomes apparent.
